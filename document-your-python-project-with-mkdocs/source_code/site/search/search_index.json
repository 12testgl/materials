You'll tackle common tasks that you might have with the help of the code provided in this project. How To Add Two Numbers? You have two numbers and you need to add them together. You're in luck! The calculator package can help you get this done. Download the code from this GitHub repository and place the calculator/ folder in the same directory as your Python script: your_project/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 calculator/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 calculations.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 your_script.py Inside of your_script.py you can now import the add() function from the calculator.calculations module: # your_script.py from calculator.calculations import add After you've imported the function, you can use it to add any two numbers that you need to add: # your_script.py from calculator.calculations import add print(add(20, 22)) # OUTPUT: 42 Using only one import statement, you're now able to add any two numbers.","title":"How-To Guide"},{"location":"how-to-guide/#how-to-guide","text":"This part of the project documentation focuses on a problem-oriented approach.
