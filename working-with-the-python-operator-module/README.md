# Working With the Python operator Module

This folder contains supplementary code for the Real Python tutorial on [Working With the Python operator Module](https://realpython.com/python-operator-module/). You can copy the code examples, or continue your learning by experimenting more with them.

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment. 

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

For most of the examples, you'll use the `operator`, `pickle`, 'dataclasses' and `timeit` modules.  All of these come built in to Python. No additional installation is necessary.

## Usage

After creating and activating your virtual environment, you should be able to run each individual file normally:

```bash
(venv) $ python filename.py
```

You can find more information and context on the code blocks in [Working With the Python operator Module](https://realpython.com/python-operator-module/).
