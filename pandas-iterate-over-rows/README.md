# How to Iterate Over a pandas DataFrame's Rows

In these supplementary materials you'll find the examples discussed in the tutorial, along with some bonus materials.

The main extra dependency for the bonus materials is [perfplot](https://github.com/nschloe/perfplot). To install all dependencies into your venv

```shell
$ python -m pip install pandas httpx codetiming perfplot
```

You'll also find some additional code samples along the way, showing alternatives to looping, such as by using list comprehensions, and even alternative ways of looping.
