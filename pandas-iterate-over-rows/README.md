# How to Iterate Over a pandas DataFrame's Rows

In these supplementary materials you'll find the examples discussed in the tutorial [How to Iterate Over Rows in pandas, and Why You Shouldn't](https://realpython.com/pandas-iterate-over-rows/), along with some bonus materials.

In addition to the third-party packages used in the tutorial, you should also install [perfplot](https://github.com/nschloe/perfplot) to play with the bonus examples. To install all dependencies into your virtual environment, you can run the following command:

```console
$ python -m pip install pandas httpx codetiming perfplot
```

You'll also find some additional code samples along the way, showing alternatives to looping, such as by using list comprehensions, and even alternative ways of looping.
